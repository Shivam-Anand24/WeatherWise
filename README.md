Project Overview: Android Weather App using OpenWeather API

The Android Weather App is designed to provide users with real-time weather information for their current location or any specific city. The app utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data and displays it in a responsive user interface. 

Here's an overview of the project:

1. User Interface (UI):
   - The UI is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing an intuitive experience for the app's users.
   - The UI components include text views, image views, buttons, and other relevant widgets to display weather information.
   - The UI is designed using XML layouts and can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

2. Location Tracking:
   - The app incorporates location tracking functionality to determine the user's current location.
   - The device's GPS or network providers are used to obtain the latitude and longitude coordinates.
   - This information is then used to fetch weather data for the user's current location.

3. Weather Data Retrieval:
   - The app integrates the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data.
   - It makes HTTP requests to the API endpoints using the appropriate query parameters such as latitude, longitude, or city name.
   - The API responses are obtained in JSON format, which is then parsed to extract the required weather information.

4. Displaying Weather Information:
   - The app extracts relevant weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions from the API response.
   - The retrieved weather data is displayed in the UI using appropriate UI components.
   - The app may include icons or images to represent weather conditions, enhancing the visual experience for users.

5. User Interaction and Functionality:
   - The app allows users to search for weather information for a specific city.
   - Users can enter the name of the city through text input fields or select from a list of suggested cities.
   - The app responds to user interactions such as button clicks or menu selections to trigger weather data retrieval and display updates.

6. Error Handling and User Feedback:
   - The app handles scenarios where the API request fails or returns invalid data.
   - Appropriate error messages or notifications are displayed to the user in such cases.
   - The app may also provide feedback to the user during the data retrieval process, such as displaying loading indicators or progress bars.
